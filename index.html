             <p>Tell us about why you are applying for the programme?––––––––

I need to learn coding. Its something I’ve been fascinated since
being introduced to it in my music studies. I would love to acquire this
skill in such a strong way as FAC course offers: learning with the like minded people.
Also I admire the impact FAC has on the community, and the values it stands for.
